In this project, we use logistic regression to analyze the importance of age, weight, and height for your chances to win an Olympics competition. 


Findings:
- Height, weight, and age are significant in sports like men's road cycling, women's tennis, and men's sailing. The model is confident in predicting whether someone won based on their age, weight, and height.
- Some magnitudes for coefficients are irregularly high, likely indicating which attributes are important to your chances of winning the particular sport. 
- Being older is quite important to your chances in winning for men's handball, women's hockey, and women's artistic gymnastics. Being young is quite important to your chances of winning men's beach volleyball. 
- It is particularly important to be tall in women's swimming.
- It is particularly important to be heavy in women's football.
